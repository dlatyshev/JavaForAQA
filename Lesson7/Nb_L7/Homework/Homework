1) Create a new interface "Flyable". This interface should have one method "void fly()". Create two new classes "Bird" and
"Duck" which implement "Flyable" interface. Provide your implementation for the "fly" method.
2) Create a new interface "Converter". This interface should have one method "convert(double celsius)".
 Provide several implementations of the "Converter" interface like "KelvinConverter" and "FahrenheitConverter"
 which convert celsius degrees to kelvins or fahrenheits accordingly.
3) Create two interfaces Volume and State:
interface Volume {
    void changeVolume(double value);
}

interface State {
   void on();
   void off();
}

Create a new class "MyDevice" which implements both interfaces. Provide your implementations of methods.

4) Write a project named "Remote Device". Create a class "RemoteController" which will be simulation the real one to control the TV.
Create interfaces Device and Volume. The "Device" interface should have methods powerOn(), powerOff(), setChannel(int channel),
 and currentChannel(); The "Volume" interface should have methods "upVolume(), downVolume() and mute();
Write an abstract class TVDevice which will be implementing interfaces Volume and Device and has the fields String
 modelName and boolean isOn (Tip: You don't need to implement methods from the interfaceif you class is abstract).
Write a class "TV" which extends the class TVDevice. Implements all the methods.
Write a class RemoteController to control your TV.
