1. Given a string firstName equals to "Den" and lastName equals to "Brown". Print to the console the full name in the following format: "-FirstName=LastName-"

2. Given a string. Write a code that will create a new string made of the first two characters of the initial string.
If the string is shorter than length 2, return whatever there is, so "X" yields "X", and the empty string "" yields the empty string "".

For example:
"AE_1381" -> "AE"
"A" -> "A"
"" -> ""

3. The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Hello</i>" which draws Hello as italic text. In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Hello".
Given a tag and a word string, create the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Hello</i>".

Task: word = Welcome to Java World, tag=p

For example:
tag=h1, words=Java Tutorials -> <h1>Java Tutorials</h1>


4. Given two strings. Check if they start with "The".

   Task: word1 = "The End", word2="End The";


5. Given a string "ABCDEFGHIJK". You need to make this string lowercased and remove all vowels.


6. Given 2 strings, a and b. Create a string c of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside.

   Task: a = "hop", b = "hello"

7. Given a user's email address: john_smith@example.com. Create two strings "login" and "domain" which will be substrings of full email address.
   The First Name and Last Name of the user should be in the following format: "Name Surname".

8. Given a string "Den, John, Will, Kate, Adam, Robin". Print all the names from the following string each from a new line.
   Example:
   Den
   John
   Will
   Kate
   ...

9. Given some random string s. Verify if that string ends with ".". If so, leave this string as is. If not - add it. Test strings create on your own.


10. Write a program which prints "Hello world" to the console using methods transformIntToChar and printList only.
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // write your code here
    }

    private static mypackage.one.ArrayList<Character> transformIntToChar(int... values) {
        mypackage.one.ArrayList<Character> buffer = new mypackage.one.ArrayList<>();
        for (int i: values) {
            buffer.add(((char) i));
        }
        return buffer;
    }

    private static void printList(mypackage.one.ArrayList<Character> characters) {
        for (char c: characters) {
            System.out.print(c);
        }
    }

}
