1) Create a simple program, that creates two integers and print the result of calculation of their addition, substruction, multiplication and division. 
2) Create a simple program that calculates and prints the square of a rectangle and a circle. Import and use Math class.
3) Create an array of 10 integers. Fill this array using for-loop with random numbers. Print all the elements of this array to the console. Each element from the new line.
4) Create an array of 10 integers. Find the square root of each element and put the to result array. Print the result array to the console.
5) Create a program that calculates the factorial of an integer value n.
6) Create a program that print to the console following figures. Use loops, asterisks("*") and spaces (" ").

7) Create an array of 10 integers. Calculate and print the sum of all its elements except the first one and the last one.
8) Print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 or divisible by 5, but not divisible by 2.
9) Create an array of any length and fill it with random integers. Using loops and conditions sort this array and print it out to the console. You can use any sorting algorithm you want. Do not use build-in methods to sort the array.
